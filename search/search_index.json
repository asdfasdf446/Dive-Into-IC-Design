This book embraces that philosophy: first, we'll show you how things are done, then we'll delve into the 'what' and 'why'. Don't worry about fully grasping every concept immediately. Follow along step-by-step. If you encounter something unclear, don't get bogged down. Keep going, and revisit those tricky spots later. For code you don't understand, AI tools can be invaluable assistants. This \"learn by doing\" approach might seem superficial at first, but it's far more effective than getting lost in the theory and giving up in frustration.","title":"How to read this book?"},{"location":"chapter_1_Overview/what/","text":"","title":"What is this book about?"}]}
