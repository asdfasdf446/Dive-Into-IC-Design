# TOP Verification Methodology

TOP-level (TOP) verification is one of the most integrated and complex components in the entire verification workflow. This document combines methodological principles with key technical knowledge to provide a comprehensive and executable strategy for conducting TOP-level validation efficiently.

## 1. Core Principles

### 1.1 Reporting and Execution: Emphasizing Upward and Downward Synchronization

- **Upward Management**:
    - Decompose work into modules, define progress milestones, and assign responsible owners.
    - Use a Portal for visibility and expectation alignment with leadership.
    - Ensure reports are concise and highlight conclusions and objectives clearly.

- **Downward Management**:
    - Synchronize regularly to avoid unexpected escalations.
    - Require updates every Thursday before end of day with clear deadlines to avoid ambiguity.

### 1.2 Clear Positioning: Validation Objectives and Role Division

- **Validation Objective**:
    - Focus on system-level scenarios that module-level verification cannot cover.
    - Emphasize validating end-to-end flows and subsystem integration, ignoring low-level module internals.

- **Role Division**:
    - **TOP Leader**: Responsible for defining methodology and overall orchestration.
    - **Team Members**: Execute based on capability. Strategy-making should be limited to a core few; others execute tasks or debug.

### 1.3 Simplification and Standardization

- **Avoid Inefficiencies**:
    1. **Sudden Ideas**: Avoid ad hoc instructions without follow-up.
    2. **Over-regulation**: Avoid making others fill complex templates or strict formats.
    3. **Frequent Policy Shifts**: Prevent inconsistent directions that confuse execution.

- **Reverse Practice (What to Do)**:
    1. **Jira-Centric Flow**: Turn all plans into Jira—either Bug or Case tickets. Let Jira reflect reality.
    2. **Self-Maintained Tools**: All forms/portals are maintained by TOP leads; team members only focus on assigned Jira.
    3. **Steady Process**: Stick to a weekly, repeatable flow so even less experienced team members can keep up.

## 2. Work Phases

TOP verification follows a five-phase process that enables structured progress and consistent output.

### Phase 1: Initial Debugging

- Start with basic Apollo Cases and verify them to establish a stable starting point.

### Phase 2: Regression and Error Classification

- Run regression with remaining cases.
- Create Bug Jira tickets and classify them using a Portal for clear ownership.

### Phase 3: Standard Workflow Established

```
Regression → Assign Bug Jira → Portal Auto-Update → Weekly Report
```

- Ensure automated updates and clear reporting.

### Phase 4: Task Decomposition and Function Coverage

- Introduce a **Task Portal** for case generation ownership.
- Owners are responsible for new case creation for their assigned flows/subsystems.
- Collect function coverage reports to validate completeness.

### Phase 5: Final Cleanup and Multi-Dimensional Regression

- Execute different regression suites in parallel.
- Finalize by closing all Jira and reporting complete validation coverage.

## 3. Technical Scope of TOP Verification

TOP verification also involves deep technical knowledge across multiple system dimensions.

### 3.1 Testbench (TB) Integration

- **Module Agent Integration**: Incorporate all module-level agents into the TOP-level environment.
- **Bus Configurations**:
    - **Active Agents**: PCIe, DDR, Ethernet, Flash, UART, SPI, etc.
    - **Passive Agents**: AXI, AHB, GMII, internal custom interfaces.

### 3.2 System Knowledge (for Debugging)

- **Data Flow**: Understand TX/RX paths and module data transformations.
- **Registers**:
    - Knowledge of configuration interfaces (PCIe, JTAG, FW, etc.).
    - Awareness of chip mode settings and boot-time initialization.
- **Interrupts**:
    - Must verify system-wide interrupt responses (e.g., ECC, counter thresholds).
- **Performance**:
    - Validate metrics like bandwidth, latency, cache hit rates.
- **Clock & Reset**:
    - Confirm correct configuration and reset of all clock domains.
- **Power Domains**:
    - Verify independent domain power-up and correct voltage ranges.

### 3.3 Non-ASIC Specific Tasks

- **FPGA Verification**: Build and simulate FPGA images for early validation.
- **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)**:
    - Pre- and post-layout verification of synthesized netlists.
- **Acceleration/Emulation**:
    - Adjust module use based on maturity.
    - Use stubs to replace unrelated modules during slow simulations.
- **Automatic Test Equipment (ATE)**:
    - Generate production test patterns, especially for PHYs.

## 4. Continuous Improvement

### 4.1 SOP & Signoff Checklist Optimization

- Collect pain points from each generation and evolve them into SOPs.
- Update checklists accordingly.
- Accumulated knowledge improves both verification quality and organizational maturity.

## 5. Conclusion

The essence of successful TOP verification lies in:

- ✅ **Goal-Oriented Execution**
- ✅ **Process Clarity and Simplification**
- ✅ **Technical Breadth and Team Collaboration**

By combining sound methodology with a detailed understanding of SoC-level complexity, TOP verification can become a scalable, repeatable, and highly reliable part of your product development lifecycle.
